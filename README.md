# PAM_Clustering
Exploring the Lung cancer subtypes by clustering the mRNA data
#Question: Are there subtypes of NSCLC other than two major subtypes (described by the classical staging system), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC- accounting for approximately 80% of all primary lung cancers)?

Clustering methods can provide subsets of observations/genes that may reveal some phenotype related subgroups such as cancer subtypes within the data sets. One of the usages of the clustering methods is for DNA microarray data. 

The PAM (partitioning around medoids) algorithm is based on the search for k representative objects or medoids among the observations using dissimilarity values between the objects. After finding a set of k medoids, k clusters will be provided by assigning each observation to the nearest medoid. The aim of PAM is to find k representative objects, in such a way that the sum of dissimilarities of the observations to their closest representative object is minimized. Also, agglomerative Hierarchical clustering was performed based on complete linkage method to build hierarchy of clusters. In agglomerative Hierarchical clustering, each observation is a small cluster including that single observation. Then clusters will keep merging until only one cluster remains with all the observations.


Using mRNA and miRNA data Hierarchical clustering based on complete linkage method and PAM clustering (partitioning around medoids) were performed to see if some new subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) could be revealed. Result from hierarchical clustering and PAM (cluster package) of observations for mRNA data are showed in figure 1&2. Regarding the results, it seems that there are more that 3 clusters. Also, regarding plot from PAM object, it seems there are many over laps between 3 clusters so there should be more clusters suggesting existence of some new subtypes of disease besides AC, SCC and LCC.

Regarding plot from PAM object, it seems there are many over laps for 3 clusters situation. So probably there should be other subtypes of NSCLC besides SCC, LCC and AC. It seems with 5 chosen number of clusters, less overlaps between clusters can be detected.  The optimum number of clusters were 2 for both miRNA and mRNA data.

Result from PAM clustering of genes from miRNA data is showed in Figure3. There are many overlaps between the three clusters so probably there are some new groups that can be addressed by some of the genes. However using function pamk from package (fpc) resulted in 3 clusters of genes as optimum number of clusters based on average silhouette width for miRNA data. 

Hopach Function form “Hopach” package also was used and clusters were produced for miRNA data and the proportion of times a gene belongs to the cluster was calculated. The bootplot function was implemented to provide barplot of the bootstrap reappearance proportions for each gene and each cluster. Figure 5 shows the barplot. Each gene is showed as narrow horizontal bar. If the color of the bar is one color, then the gene is estimated to belong to that cluster otherwise it belongs to more than one cluster. Regarding figure 5, it seems there are 3 major cluster of genes probably related to SCC, Ac and LCC but also there are additional clusters of gens suggesting that there should be more subtypes of cancer NSCLC related with those genes.
